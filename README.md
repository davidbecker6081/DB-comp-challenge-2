# DB-comp-challenge-2

The goal of this project was to mimic the general design and layout of the presented static comp. I was given creative liberty with aspects of design and content: including theme, color, content, and responsiveness. As you scale the screen resolution down, the cards shift to accomodate any size, resizing the content appropriately. Below you will find a picture of the presented static comp and a few pictures of different layouts of my own design.
